# Why
The goal of this app is for myself to track my hours on a compressed schedule. And to practice designing code, and using python. Oh and, for fun!

# TODO
* delete a time entry
* validation of different/unexpected user inputs

# FEATURE IDEAS
* option to configure and update cycle hours and num days in cycle for first time use
* improve CLI command handling. I want to look into how other programs handle parsing user input, especially with variable flags/values to interpret. An idea would be some kind of user input controller where I can configure accepted inputs and input combos and how to handle them.

# BUGS
- saving banked time doesn't work for now
   - need to make sure it calculates the time properly
   - when new cycle, need to subtract total expected time in a cycle by what was worked in the cycle
